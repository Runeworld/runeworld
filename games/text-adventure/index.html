        Darkness.
        All you see, all you know in this moment is this darkness, an empty void that envelops your entire being. You
        think to reach out in front of you and notice that you can't see yourself, you don't seem to be there at all and
        you find it strange that this somehow doesn't bother you in the least.

        Short inner dialogue here I guess
    </p>
    <p class="narration">
        A faint voice abruptly interrupts your thoughts and softly echoes throughout the void. The voice is strangely
        familiar, although you can't seem to discern who it is. The voice begins to echo steadily louder and for a brief
        moment you feel a wave of longing and homesickness wash over you as you realize the voice is saying goodbye. You
        aren't ready to say goodbye. Left with nothing but a gnawing feeling of something unfinished, the voice fades as abruptly as it began
        and in its stead a single point of light resembling a lone star in the night sky appears far in the distance, its dim glow a warm and welcoming
        invitation in stark contrast to the nothingness you've found yourself in.
